             the holy city of Amritsar. Two versions of stories exist regarding the land where<b>Guru

               <br>

After the coronation Guru Ram Das in 1574, who faced hostile opposition from the sons of <b>Guru Amar Das</b>, he founded the town; it was named after him as <b>"Ramdaspur"</b>. He first completed the pool, and built his new official Guru centre and home next to it. He invited merchants and artisans from other parts of India to settle into the new town with him. The town expanded during the time of<a href="https://www.sikhnet.com/news/guru-argun-dev-ji"> Guru Arjan Dev</a>, financed by donations and constructed by volunteers. town grew to become the city of Amritsar. After the son of Guru Amar Das built the gurdwara Harmandir Sahib, the pool area developed further as a temple complex.<b> In 1604 Amar Das's son installed </b>the scripture of Sikhism inside the new temple.<br>

<h4>Topography of Amritsar</h4>
    At about an average height of 755 feet above sea level, there are many natural and man-made hurdles which cause problems in the city. Amritsar is prone to heavy rainfalls which later don’t flow easily because of the stoppages. This often leads to road blocks and even flooding in the city. The city rests on a saucer shaped basin which also results in the indirect flow of the water coming in.

<font size="+2"><b>Health</b> is a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being, and not just the absence of disease. It's a positive concept that emphasizes personal and social resources, as well as physical capabilities. Health is also the ability to function well in the face of changing circumstances. <br>

<b>Education</b>Education is the transmission of knowledge, skills, and character traits and manifests in various forms. Formal education occurs within a structured institutional framework, such as public schools, following a curriculum. Non-formal education also follows a structured approach but occurs outside the formal schooling system, while informal education entails unstructured learning through daily experiences. Formal and non-formal education are categorized into levels, including early childhood education, primary education, secondary education, and tertiary education.

<h2 align="center" id="c2">Culture</h2><hr>
<font size="+2">Sikh culture is influenced by<b>militaristic motifs (with the Khanda the most obvious)</b>, and most Sikh artifacts—except for the relics of the Gurus—have a military theme. This theme is evident in the Sikh festivals of<b> Hola Mohalla and Vaisakhi</b>, which feature marching and displays of valor.<br>
<div align="center"><img src="cul.jpeg" > <img src="sikh.jpeg"> </div> <br>
Punjab holds numerous religious and seasonal festivals, such as Dussehra, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hinduism">  Hindu</a> festival celebrating the victory of <b> Prince Rama</b> over the demon king Ravana, as recounted in the epic <b>Ramayana; Diwali</b>, a festival of lights celebrated by both Hindus and Sikhs; and Baisakhi, which for Hindus is a<i><b> new year’s festival</i></b> and for Sikhs is both an agricultural festival and a celebration of the birth of the community’s Khalsa order. There also are numerous anniversary celebrations in honour of the Gurus (the 10 historical leaders of Sikhism) and various saints. Dancing is a typical feature of such festivities, with<i><b> bhangra, jhumar, and sammi</i></b> among the most popular genres. Giddha, a native Punjabi tradition, is a humorous song-and-dance genre performed by women. In addition to Sikh religious music, semiclassical Mughal forms, such as the khyal dance and the<b><i> ṭhumrī, ghazal, and qawwālī vocal performance genres,</i></b> continue to be popular.</font><hr>
<h2 align="center" id="q1">Economy</h2><hr>
    <h3>Agriculture</h3>
    Some two-fifths of Punjab’s population is engaged in the agricultural sector, which accounts for a significant segment of the state’s gross product. Punjab produces an important portion of India’s food grain and contributes a major share of the wheat and rice stock held by the Central Pool (a national repository system of surplus food grain). Much of the state’s agricultural progress and productivity is attributable to the so-called<a href="https://www.downtoearth.org.in/agriculture/the-green-revolution-and-a-dark-punjab-72318"> Green Revolution</a>, an international movement launched in the 1960s that introduced not only new agricultural technologies but also high-yielding varieties of wheat and rice.<br>
    <br>
    Aside from<i> wheat and rice, corn (maize), barley, and pearl millet are important cereal products of Punjab. Although the yield of pulses (legumes)</i> has declined since the late 20th century, there has been a rapid increase in the commercial production of fruit, especially citrus, mangoes, and guavas. Other major crops include cotton, sugarcane, oilseeds, chickpeas, peanuts (groundnuts), and vegetables.<br>
    <br>
    With almost the entire cultivated area receiving irrigation, Punjab is among India’s most widely irrigated states. Government-owned canals and wells are the main sources of irrigation; canals are most common in southern and southwestern Punjab, while wells are more typical of the north and the northeast. The <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Bhakra-Nangal-project">Bhakra Dam project</a> in neighbouring Himachal Pradesh provides much of Punjab’s supply of irrigation water.</h2><hr>
<h2 align="center" id="z1">Transport facilites</h2><hr>
<font size="+2">
    Punjab has one of the best-developed road networks in the country. All-weather paved roads extend to most villages, and the state is crossed by a number of national highways. Punjab also is well served by the Northern Railway—part of the national railway system. There is an international airport in Amritsar, and regular domestic service is available in Chandigarh and Ludhiana. Several other airports offer cargo service.
</font><hr>
<h2>Public Transport</h2>
<br>
<font size="+2">There have been many attempts to better the public transportation system in Amritsar, but all in vain. In a city which remains very crowded, there are services to choose from, but not the best that the city has to offer. 

    However, the charm of the city overpowers it all and in the lack of few top class services, one finds solace. Amritsar is primarily a city with a high standard of living so people living here have the best of cars and prefer their personal vehicles.<br>
<br><b>Air</b>
<br>
<b>Sri Guru Ram Das Ji International Airport</b><br>
<br>
Amritsar hosts Sri Guru Ram Das Ji International Airport. The airport is connected to other parts of India and other countries with direct international flights to cities and is the 12th busiest airport in the country in terms of international traffic. It serves Amritsar and several other districts in Punjab and neighbouring states.<br>
<br>
<b>Rail</b><br>
<br>
Amritsar Junction railway station is the main station serving Amritsar. It is the busiest railway station in Indian state of Punjab and one of the highest revenue-generating station of Northern Railways. Due to high traffic at the Amritsar Junction railway station]], Indian Railways has planned to develop two satellite stations-Chheharta and Bhagtanwala, in order to decongest traffic at this station. As many as 6 trains would be shifted to Chheharta railway station in the first phase.The Indian Railway Stations Development Corporation has also planned to make the Amritsar Junction railway station a world-class railway station on lines of the international airport based on PPP model. The project has received an overwhelming response with bids from 7 private firms, including GMR.<br>
<br>
<b>Road</b><br>
<br>
Amritsar is located on the historic Grand Trunk Road (G.T. Road), also known as NH 1 now renumbered as National Highway 3. An expressway by name of Delhi–Amritsar–Katra Expressway at the cost of ₹25,000 crore is approved under Bharatmala scheme which will cut the travel time from Amritsar to New Delhi by road from current 8 hours, to 4 hours.Another expressway, called Amritsar–Jamnagar Expressway is under construction which will connect Amritsar to Jamnagar in Gujarat. Additionally, NH 54 (Old NH15), NH 354 and NH 503A connect Amritsar to other parts of state and rest of India. A ring road will also be built surrounding all 4 sides of Amritsar<br>
<br>
₹ 450,000,000 is being spent to expand the Amritsar-Jalandhar stretch of G.T. Road to four lanes. In 2010, elevated road with four lanes connected to the National highway for better access to the Golden Temple has been started.<br>
<br>
<b>Amritsar MetroBus</b>

Amritsar has a bus rapid transit service, the Amritsar Metrobus which was launched on 28 January 2019. 93 fully air-conditioned Tata Marcopolo buses are used for the service connecting places like

    Experts gathered during the day-long ‘Noncon —- Now or Never Conversation’ at Khalsa College today urged the State and Centre to come up with a focused Climate Action Plan (CAP). Focusing on the need to tap renewable energy solutions to cut carbon emissions, they said there is no time left and governments and communities need to awaken to find ways to save the environment.
    
    The panel of experts at the conference included Karan Avtar Singh, former Chief Secretary, Punjab and Chairperson, Punjab Water Regulation and Development Authority; Rajan Mehta, Harvard alumni and author; Dr Devinder Sharma, agri-economist and Ravi Singh, Secretary General and CEO, WWF-India.
    
    While seeking community participation and specific measures to check rising pollution, they focused on immediate and emphatic efforts to take on the environmental hazards including air, water and climatic degradation. “If we do not do something about these issues now, we might soon find ourselves regretting having missed the opportunity. Regenerative agriculture, rejuvenation of aquifers, wetlands and plantation to create forests will go a long way in mitigating the impact of climate change,” shared Ravi Singh as he presented how WWF-India has been able to engage communities in eco-conservation, whether in Sundarbans or Harike wetlands.
    
    “We need to lower our dependency on fossil fuels for energy generation. About 35 to 37 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide is produced in generation of energy by using hydrocarbons. We need to consider the redesigning of our grid systems, energy distribution and generation, which is more suitable for green energies including wind and solar. All these changes might take some time, but we need to run, not walk towards them,” said Rajan Mehta.<br>
    
    The pooling of resources, adopting local biodiversity, large-scale plantation of vegetation in all available spaces, focused studies on climatic conditions and water table recharging by involving students were some of the immediate measures suggested. The Noncon was organised by Dilbir Foundation and CII jointly in collaboration with Khalsa College, Amritsar.<br>
    <br>
    “We are killing the earth even as we explore possibilities of life on Mars and colonising the moon. If we are to rejuvenate these barren terrains to make them habitable for human beings, we should first start mending our ways on our own planet, by far the only sphere in the universe with a known ability to sustain life,” said Gunbir Singh, Chairman, Dilbir Foundation, who was moderating the discussion.
    
    Karan Avtar Singh said that community participation was important to chalk out the strategies and people have to be mobilised to act. Principal, Khalsa College, Dr Mehal Singh said that educating the coming generations about the challenge of climate change through such interactions would bring in fresh perspectives and solutions.</font>

        Personnel of the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) recovered 15 bullets of 9 mm from an NRI going to the US at Sri Guru Ram Dass Jee International airport here on Friday.

The suspect has been identified as Amardeep Singh, who had come to his native village in Gurdaspur and stayed here for a long time. The CISF personnel recovered the cartridges from his bag when his luggage was checked before the plane takeoff.

KS Victor, CISF Sub-Inspector, Amritsar airport police station, said the luggage of accused Amardeep Singh, a resident of New Jersey in the US, was checked as per the routine. ASI Baljit Singh on checking duty found the bullets from him and immediately arrested him. Soon after being arrested, Amardeep Singh developed some medical issues and was immediately admitted to hospital. Amardeep Singh will be remanded by the police after being discharged from the hospital.</font>

<h2 align="center "id="pe1">People</h2><hr>
<h3>   Population composition</h3>
<font size="+2">The people of Punjab are mainly descendants of the so-called<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryan">Aryan tribes</a> that entered India from the northwest during the<b>2nd millennium bce</b>, as well as the pre-Aryan population, probably Dravidians (speakers of Dravidian languages), who had a highly developed civilization. Relics of this civilization have been unearthed at Rupnagar (Ropar). Successive waves of<i> invaders—Greeks, Parthians, Kushans, and Hephthalites (Hunas)—added to the diversity of earlier social, or caste, groups (jatis)</i>. Later, invaders under the banner of Islam forced several vanquished groups (such as the Jat peasant caste and the Rajput class of landowners) to convert to the Muslim faith, although many conversions were voluntary under the influence of Sufi saints.<br>
<br>
    Today, however, the majority religion of Punjab is Sikhism, which originated from the teachings of<a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Guru-Nanak"> Nanak, the first Sikh Guru</a>. Hindus make up the largest minority, but there also is a significant population of Muslims. There are small communities of<b> Christians and Jains</b> in some areas. Some <b>two-fifths</b> of Punjab’s population consists of Hindus and Sikhs who officially belong to the Scheduled Castes (formerly called “untouchables”), which occupy a relatively low position within the traditional Indian caste system.<br>
    <br>
    Punjabi is the official state language. Along with Hindi, it is the most widely spoken. However, many people also speak English and Urdu.</font><hr>
